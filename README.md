Title: Web Programming Node.js Project

Description:
My web programming project developed using Node.js, a powerful runtime environment for building server-side applications. 
Leveraging the versatility and scalability of Node.js, I created a dynamic and robust web application with a focus on performance and maintainability.

Key Features:

1.Server-Side Development: Utilized Node.js to build the backend logic of the web application, handling requests, processing data, and interacting with databases.
2.Express Framework: Integrated the Express.js framework to streamline routing, middleware implementation, and request handling, enhancing code organization and readability.
3.RESTful API Design: Designed and implemented RESTful APIs to enable seamless communication between the client-side interface and the server, facilitating data exchange and manipulation.
4.Database Integration: Incorporated database technologies such as MySQL to store and manage application data, ensuring efficient data retrieval and persistence.
5.Authentication and Authorization: Implemented user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
6.Frontend Integration: Integrated frontend technologies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a cohesive and interactive user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.
